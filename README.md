Simple console rock paper scissors game in javascript

UI Plan:
- Rock paper scissors icons in the bottom of the screen
- Computer choice in the middle of the screen 
- Score at the top of the screen (wins vs losses)

Additional Ideas:
- computer choice rolls like a slot machine after user choice and locks the user from making another choice until the animation is done (event listener) 
- Keyboard functionality (r for paper, etc.)
- Sounds for choices and the spinning slot machine computer choice
- player choice lights up until the round is done

Advanced features:
- Japanese Language Mode (toggle)
