UI Plan:

- Computer choice in the middle of the screen 
- Score at the top of the screen (wins vs losses)

Advanced features to add later:
- Japanese Language Mode (toggle) 
- Keyboard functionality (r for paper, etc.)
- computer choice rolls like a slot machine after user choice and locks the user from making another choice until the animation is done (event listener) 
- Sounds for choices and the spinning slot machine computer choice
